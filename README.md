## Synopsis

kCalDAV is a simple, safe, and minimal CalDAV server depending only on
[kcgi(3)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi),
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), and expat(3). The ISO C source code is
ISC licensed.
For the time being, it works only for simple setups, for example, a
calendar collection shared between Mozilla Lightning, Mac OS X iCal, and
iOS (iPhone) clients.
It compiles and runs on OpenBSD, Linux, and Mac OS X.
However, OpenBSD is the only system for which kCalDAV has deeper
security integration (via [pledge(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2)).

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for examples.

This is the README file for display with
[GitHub](https://www.github.com), which hosts a read-only source
repository of the project. 
To keep up to date with the current stable release of kCalDAV, visit the
[kCalDAV website](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcaldav).
You can still submit bug reports here, however.
