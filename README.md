## Synopsis

kCalDAV is a simple, safe, and minimal CalDAV server depending only on
[kcgi(3)](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi),
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), and expat(3). The ISO C source code is
ISC licensed.  For the time being, it works only for simple setups, for
example, a calendar collection shared between Mozilla Lightning, Mac OS
X iCal, and iOS7 (iPhone4) clients. It compiles and runs on OpenBSD,
Linux, and Mac OS X: see the [Makefile](Makefile) for examples.

This is the README file for display with
[GitHub](https://www.github.com), which hosts a read-only source
repository of the project. 
To keep up to date with the current stable release of kCalDAV, visit the
[kCalDAV website](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcaldav).
You can still submit bug reports here, however.
