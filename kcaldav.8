.Sh NAME
.Nm kcaldav
.Nd simple CalDav server
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 only.
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcaldav
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
CGI program minimally implements CalDAV, with an emphasis on strong
authorisation and simplicity.
To use
.Nm ,
you'll need to first populate your
.Dv CALDIR
.Pq set during compile time
with a password file (for HTTP authorisation, see
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5 ) ,
then for each collection (calendar directory), create a configuration
file (see
.Xr kcaldav.conf 5 )
defining the permissions of that collection and other information.
.Pp
Once finished, you can point your calendar client to the owned
collection within
.Dv CALDIR .
.Pp
For example, assume the script has been installed into
.Pa /var/www/cgi-bin
and is reachable at
.Pp
.D1 http://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav.cgi
.Pp
Moreover, assume
.Dv CALDIR
is set to
.Pa /var/www/caldav ,
which contains
.Pa kcaldav.passwd ;
and you have installed a single collection at
.Pa /var/www/caldav/kristaps
consisting of
.Pa kcaldav.conf
and some calendars.
You can point your browser to the following:
.Pp
.D1 http://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav.cgi/kristaps/
.Pp
Note the trailing slash, otherwise the request is interpreted as for a
resource (file), not a collection (directory).
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Internally,
.Nm
maintains file consistency by using file locks and temporary files.
When new resources are submitted, the new resource is always written
into a temporary file, which is the existing filename with a leading
dot.
(Leading-dot files are thus always ignored when accessing files and
disallowed for resource submission.)
By writing into a temporary file,
.Nm
can safely check for file-system limits.
.Pp
After writing, the requested file is uniquely opened and exclusively
locked, replaced with the temporary file, then unlocked.
.Pp
If the requested file exists and is meant for overwrite, the existing
file is opened and exclusively locked, its digest checked for
consistency, then the new file replaced before unlocking.
.Pp
Resource read-access is simpler: files are opened with shared locks.
This allows simultaneous read-access whilst protecting file
modification.
.Pp
This behaviour depends upon standards-defined behaviour of
.Xr open 2
with
.Dv O_EXCL ,
.Dv O_SHLOCK
and
.Dv O_EXLOCK ;
.Xr flock 2
with
.Dv LOCK_EX
and
.Dv LOCK_SH ;
and
.Xr rename 2 .

.\" .Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh FILES
The following files are required in the
.Ev CALDIR
root set during compilation time.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /kcaldav.passwd
Authorisation for all principals.
See
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5 .
.It Pa /<collection>/kcaldav.conf
Given a directory path
.Pa <collection> ,
the
.Pa kcaldav.conf
file defines the collection properties.
See
.Xr kcaldav.conf 5 .
.El
.Pp
The following files may be created during runtime:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /<collection>/kcaldav.ctag
A cache file for the collection's ctag (entity tag for the collection).
This is automatically created and updated.
.El
.\" .Sh EXIT STATUS
.\" For sections 1, 6, and 8 only.
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.
.\" .Sh ERRORS
.\" For sections 2, 3, 4, and 9 errno settings only.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility implements the following additional standards:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It RFC 2617
.Qq Digest
authentication of all users.
.It caldav-ctag-02
The
.Qq ctag
Calendar Server Extension.
.It RFC 3744
ACL queries on the authenticated principal.
.It RFC 5397
The current principal address.
.It RFC 4331
Available and used bytes in the collection file-system.
If
.Xr quotactl 2
fails (e.g., when quotas are not available),
.Xr fstatfs 2
is used to compute these values.
