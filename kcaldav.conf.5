.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kcaldav.conf
.Nd kcaldav collection configuration
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 only.
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.\" .Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" .Nm kcaldav
.\" .Op Fl options
.\" .Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration, which is always named
.Nm kcaldav.conf ,
defines properties for a CalDAV collection.
It must be exist and be well-formed for each collection (file-system
directory), else that collection is not considered by
.Xr kcaldav 8 .
An empty file is perfectly valid, although without at least one
privilege defined, useless.
.Pp
The configuration file is line-based, with blank lines discarded.
See
.Xr fparseln 3
for implementation details.
At any point in the line you may begin a comment with the
.Qq #
character: the remainder of the line will be thrown away.
You may escape the comment token with a backslash.
Line endings may also be escaped with a backslash.
.Pp
Each line consists of a token and value separated by an equal sign (and
possibly white-space), such as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
privilege = kristaps ALL
displayname = Kristaps' Calendar
.Ed
.Pp
Trailing and leading line white-space are discarded.
.Pp
The following configuration tokens are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It colour
The colour to be used when displaying calendar resources.
It must be either an RGB or RGBA string in the usual
.Li \&#rrggbbaa
format (remember to escape the
.Qq #
character).
This defaults to red.
It is only used by some clients, e.g., iCal.
.It displayname
This is the collection's natural-language name.
It may be in UTF-8.
It defaults to an empty string.
.It privilege
Define access privileges for a named principal.
This accepts the principal name then a space-separated list of
privileges.
Privileges are case insensitive and may be
.Qq NONE ,
.Qq READ ,
.Qq DELETE ,
or
.Qq WRITE.
If at any time
.Qq NONE
occurs, or the set of privileges is empty, the principal is assigned no
privileges.
You may use the
.Qq ALL
token to assign all privileges.

This file may
