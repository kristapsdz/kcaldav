			Migrate to using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> to store everything: nonces, collections, resources, configuration,
			and so on.
			This completely replaces the existing file-system based infrastructure, which was too brittle, with a single database file.
			All existing functionality is preserved, but there are some changes to be aware of if you're already using <span class="nm">kcaldav</span>.
			Foremost, you can now have multiple calendars.
			You can add calendar collections with <a href="kcaldav.passwd.1.html">kcaldav.passwd(1)</a>.
			iOS and iCal clients deal with this in the usual way, but Thunderbird will need to point directly to the calendar collection.

			To migrate an existing installation, you'll need to create a new database file with <a href="kcaldav.passwd.1.html">kcaldav.passwd(1)</a>.
			Make sure that it's read-writable by the web server process.
			You'll then need to add your iCalendar files using the same tool.
			That's it!
