		When accessing the server from a web browser (i.e., for HTML content), respond by printing the logged-in user's information and
		allow for changing of passwords or e-mail if the principal database has the correct permissions.
		This allows new users to access <code>https://server/cgi-bin/kcaldav/</code>, log in with their credentials, then perform simple
		administrative tasks without needing to log into the underlying UNIX server.
